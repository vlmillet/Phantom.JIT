# Phantom.JIT
**[Phantom.Code](https://github.com/vlmillet/Phantom.Code)** extension providing Just-In-Time asm x64 compilation based on LLVM 
(see my related project  **[LLVM JIT PDB](https://github.com/vlmillet/llvmjitpdb)** for how on-the-fly PDB debugging is done inside LLVM.

# Installation
First download, clone or fork **[Phantom](https://github.com/vlmillet/Phantom)** and **[Phantom.Code](https://github.com/vlmillet/Phantom.Code)**.

Then just copy (or mklink) every content of this repo to your **Phantom** folder.

Then run (again) the Premake-vs20XX.bat in the **Phantom** folder

# Running
Just explore, compile, run **HelloWorld.JIT** sample, put breakpoints inside the **HelloWorld.Jit.cpplite** file and see how it works ! Have fun !
